This Repo is my visualization work. It includes variety of domains: maps, data structures, high dimensional data, etc..

Warmup Visualization
=========
>Before I can handle an indivual project, I did some practice about how to present the data and realize the iteraction like **zoom**, **drag-move**, **click**, **moveover** and **moveout**. The following link is the example visualizations with interactions:
[Example Visualizations](https://wangku.github.io/Visualizations/practice.html)

Hierarchy Structure
=========
>As we all know.
>The data has the following structure as example.

> id | value
>------------|------------
>flare |
>flare.analytics|
>flare.analytics.cluster|
>flare.analytics.cluster.AgglomerativeCluster|3938
>flare.analytics.cluster.CommunityStructure	|3812
>flare.animate	|
>flare.animate.Easing	|17010
>flare.animate.FunctionSequence	|5842


>The table is part of **[flare.csv](https://github.com/Wangku/Visualizations/tree/gh-pages/flare.csv)** file. It has two columns, one is **id**, and the other is **value**. The **id** string is combined by one or several substrings with the symbol **'.'**, so it can be treated as a hierarchy structure. There are some visualizations for presenting this structure:

First Project
=========
>This is my first complex project which is based on Dr.Yao's Nature paper *[Health ROI as a measure of misalignment of biomedical needs and resources](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n8/full/nbt.3276.html)*.

>The visualization will be showed at the following link:

Maps Visualization
=========
