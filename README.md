Visualizations
========
This Repo is my visualization work. It includes variety of domains: maps, data structures, high dimensional data, etc..

Practice Visualization
--------
Before I can handle the indivual project, I did some practice about how to present and realize the iteraction like **zoom**, **drag-move**, **click**, **moveover** amd **moveout**. The following link is the example visualizations:

First Project
--------
This is my first complex project which is based on Dr.Yao's Nature paper *[Health ROI as a measure of misalignment of biomedical needs and resources](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n8/full/nbt.3276.html)*.
The visualization will be showed at the following link:
